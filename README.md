# node-html-starter

I'm a web developer, not a Node developer. Therefore I use 'http-server' as a simple web server rather than wiring up complicated and convoluted (IMO) routing and file serving features through Node. Even the 'express' web server npm package is very complex to get working without a demo. Frameworks such as Angular use http-server to demo applications to focus on the JS framework rather than focusing on Node development.

This is a node starter app that allows serving static content with the http-server npm package.

In order to run the project, you must have node installed.

From the command line execute 'npm install' to restore the package dependencies.

Then execute 'npm start' which will start the http server and open a web browser to the root of the project.
